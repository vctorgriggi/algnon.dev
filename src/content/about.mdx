i grew up taking things apart just to see how they worked. toys, gadgets, websites, anything that could be pulled apart and put back together. that curiosity never really went away; it just changed form. somewhere along the way, it became algnon, a name inspired by [Flowers for Algernon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowers_for_Algernon) and the song by [ヨルシカ (Yorushika)](https://yorushika.com/?lang=en), both about learning, change, and the quiet beauty of understanding.

to me, building something is more than just making it work. it’s about shaping what surrounds us, finding warmth in it, and leaving something that matters.

right now, i’m finishing my bachelor’s degree in software engineering and working in web development at [SECITECI](https://www.secitec.mt.gov.br/). most of my work revolves around creating and managing projects that blend logic with a sense of purpose. you can see some of them on my [/work](/work) page.

outside my professional life, i’m all about music. i love discovering new albums, collecting CDs, going to concerts — and lately, i’ve been learning the piano (my neighbors are probably not thrilled, but i’m enjoying it).

so, i’m victor — and algnon is just one more way i’ve found to give shape to that same curiosity i’ve had since i was a kid.
